<h1>代名词与先行词人称须一致</h1>
<p><u>People</u> often think that <u>our</u> difficulties are unique. （不佳）<br>
（大家经常以为我们碰到的困难是独一无二的。）</p>
<p>句中的代名词 our，代表的先行词是 people。但是，people是第三人称、our却是第一人称，并不一致。下面两种改法都符合一致性的要求，可以接受：</p>
<p><u>People</u> often think that <u>their</u> difficulties are unique.<br>
<u>We</u> often think that <u>our</u> difficulties are unique.</p>
